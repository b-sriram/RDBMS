In-memory and Conventional Database Handling

We need to see how HSQL performs out of the box when comparted to conventional mysql.

I have tried embedded HSQL, need to see how it performs when we opt for HSQL Server. Need to work on persistant data structures as well to avoid In-memory replications for read-only operations.
